## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

In the design of the Quiz game website, I've intentionally selected a colour scheme dominated by `#091f34` and `#fff` to complement the background image. `#091f34` and `#fff` serves as a subtle and clean backdrop, preventing the background image from overwhelming users. Meanwhile, the `#091f34` adds sophistication and contrast, contributing to an aesthetically pleasing and balanced visual experience. This careful integration of colors ensures that the background image enhances the overall design without overpowering or distracting users, creating a harmonious and engaging atmosphere on the website.

* I have used `#091f34` & `#fff` as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* Primary Font: [Comic Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comic+Neue?query=comic) - As a modern and cleaner twist on the classic comic book font, Comic Neue brings a playful yet readable style to our game's interface, perfect for the cartoon trivia theme.

![Comic Neue](documentation/google-fonts/comic-neue.png)

* Secondary Font: [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) - For detailed explanations, feedback, and any informational text, we use Roboto. Its high readability and versatile weights make it an excellent complement to our primary font, ensuring that all users can comfortably read game content.

### Imagery

The Toons Quiz Game is rich in vibrant and captivating imagery, carefully chosen to complement the trivia questions and immerse players in the world of cartoons.

### Wireframes

Toons Quiz Game's development process began with the creation of detailed wireframes using Balsamiq wireframes. These wireframes served as blueprints for the game's design, ensuring a user-friendly interface and a seamless experience across various screens.

### Accessibility

In developing the Quiz Game, my priority is to ensure that every player, regardless of ability, can fully participate in the fun and challenge of cartoon trivia. Accessibility isn't just a feature—it's a foundational aspect of the game's design and development.

I have also been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Optimising the website's design to be responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and phones.
* Maintaining a clear and intuitive navigation structure.
* Ensuring that users can easily navigate through the website using both keyboard and mouse.
* Implementing accessible forms with proper labels, instructions, and error messages.
* Choosing readable font styles and sizes, allowing users to adjust text as needed.
* Ensuring there is sufficient color contrast between text and background.
* Providiing descriptive alternative text for all images to assist users with visual impairments.
* Using concise and meaningful descriptions.
